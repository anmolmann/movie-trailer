## Quick Start

   - git clone "http://github.com/anmolmann/fresh_tomatoes.git"
- cd fresh_tomatoes
- *python entertainment_centre.py*

- On Windows(if not using IDLE):
   - Open a prompt: start > run > *cmd*. 
   - Navigate to your python file, using the commands *cd*(change directory) and *dir*(to show files in your directory)
   - Try *python entertainment_centre.py* 

## Documentation

This is a server-side code to store a list of your own favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This code is then used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

## Installation

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- To install python package *recordtype*:
   1. *pip install -U pip setuptools*
   2. *sudo pip install recordtype*

## Usage

Establish a foundation in core programming concepts using python. This application is written using object-oriented python and serves HTML via a web-server. You will understand the role of a simple web server has in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response.
